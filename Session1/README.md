1. **What is a neural network neuron?**
* A Neural Network Neuron is the fundamental unit of neural network. Neurons in NN are temporary in nature. They have memory storage. Each neuron has an input and output connections. Each neuron has connection with all other neurons of next layer. However, there is no connection between neurons within the same layer.

2. **What is the use of the learning rate?**
* Gradient descent algorithm involves updating the values of weights proportional to the rate of change of loss(gradient). The rate of change is typically scaled by a factor which changes the parameters slowly in general without dramatically changing the parameters. This scale factor is known as learning rate.

3. **How are weights initialized?**
* The weights are randomly initialized mostly using normal distribution in the range (-1, 1). However, other ranges can also be used.

4. **What is "loss" in a neural network?**
* A loss or a loss function is a function that computes a single numerical value that the learning process will attempt to minimize. The calculation of loss typically involves taking the difference between desired outputs for some training samples and the outputs actually produced by the model.

5. **What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow?**
* The Chain Rule of Calculus is used to compute the derivatives of functions formed by composing other functions whose derivatives are known. Back-propagation is an algorithm that computes the chain rule, with a specific order of operations that is highly efficient.
